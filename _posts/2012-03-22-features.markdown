summary: This project will use open-source tools such as OpenLayers, mapserver,
         JQuery, and PHP to produce a web-based mapping tool for viewing species
         distribution maps and reviewing observation records.

Major Features
--------------
The cornerstone of the user experience is the zoomable, draggable 
graphical map.  This will underpin the experience of birdwatchers
looking for distribution maps, the general public looking at the 
effect of climate change, species experts checking the accuracy of
observations, and researchers browsing and selecting datasets to
download for their own use.

Most users will be familiar with using a mouse to drag a map 
around and changing the viewing scale to zoom in and out, from 
using Google Maps and similar services.  Along with these
interactions the map will also support a "vetting" interface that
permits users to express their confidence in individual observation
records.

In addition, the map will support displaying the changes in 
projected distribution along a future timeline.  We expect to use
animations to show these changes, whilst still permitting the user
to view the projected distribution at specific points on the 
timeline.  Data used to construct the map will be available for
the user to download.

Technology
----------
This project will use modern web technologies to be delivered 
in-browser with no software installation imposed onto the user.
The system will employ [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/) for
the map presentation, and [JQuery](http://jquery.com) and 
[JQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com) for other interface elements.  Using 
these libraries help to make the interface operate correctly across a 
variety of web browsers.

The geospatial elements of the map site is driven by 
[MapServer](http://mapserver.org/), with the HTTP level interface
delivered by well-known web scripting language
[PHP](http://www.php.net/), using the 
[CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/) framework to provide the common 
[MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)
abstractions used to develop a robust, maintainable web application.

Data is regularly imported from the 
[Atlas of Living Australia](http://www.ala.org.au/) using
[Python](http://www.python.org/) scripts that interact with ALA 's
[web sevices](http://www.ala.org.au/about-the-atlas/downloadable-tools/web-services/).

The modelling software that turns vetted observations into distributions,
and future distributions, is provided by 
[Dr. Jeremy VanDerWal](http://www.jcu.edu.au/ctbcc/staff/JCUDEV_015851.html)
from the 
[Centre for Tropical Biodiversity & Climate Change](http://www.jcu.edu.au/ctbcc)
and uses computing resources from 
[James Cook Univesity](http://www.jcu.edu.au)'s HPC unit.

Development Effort
------------------
As the accuracy of generated distributions depends greatly on clean
observation data, encouraging species experts to contribute their 
opinions on observations is critical.  One major area of development 
effort is the user interface and surrounding system for vettings.
The vetting UI must be easily discoverable (because a bird species expert is not
necessarily familiar with technology) and low-friction (because people
vetting observations are volunteers, and we want to turn every drop of
volunteer motivation into a contribution).

The second major area of development effort will be in preparing and
displaying observations and distributions.  This involves handling 
large data sets in a way that produces results in interactive time 
frames.  The back end will need to preempt user demand to
be able to extract relevant data from storage, and cluster and 
summarise as necessary to ensure the user is not waiting a long time
for data to be displayed in their web browser.

The Source
----------
The project uses a local install of
[Redmine](http://www.redmine.org/) for project tracking, 
[Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) for integration testing,
and hosts the source at a
[github repository](https://github.com/jcu-eresearch/AP03-Research).

The source is available under the three-clause 
[BSD licence](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).
