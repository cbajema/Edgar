**Ornithological and zoological researchers** will benefit from
easy access to records of bird occurrences, already vetted for 
applicability to the generation of distributions.

**Conservation researchers** and **policy makers** will benefit from
access to current models of future species distributions using the most
recent IPCC climate change projections.  For example, 
[Professor Stephen Garnett](http://www.cdu.edu.au/research/profiles/profile_garnett.html)
from Charles Darwin University expects to use data made accessible 
by this project in his CCARGP -funded report ?Adaptation strategies 
for Australian birds?.

**Researchers** will benefit from access to a software platform suitable
for displaying and interacting with similar datasets.  For example,
[Professor Stephen Williams](http://www.jcu.edu.au/mtb/staff/academic/JCUDEV_014365.html)
from James Cook University may adapt this tool to his wet tropics 
datasets, which will subsequently improve decision making by the
[Wet Tropics Management Authority](http://www.wettropics.gov.au/).

The **Atlas of Living Australia** benefits from feedback of expert
opinions on the veracity of observations, adding to their ability to
clean their data sets.

**Birdwatchers** benefit from web access to continually updated observation records and 
distribution maps of Australian bird species.

The **general public** benefit from a visual, interactive presentation
of the effects of climate change on Australian wildlife.
