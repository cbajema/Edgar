Our primary researcher wanted to demonstrate our project to
[INBio](http://www.inbio.ac.cr), a Costa Rican NGO involved
with biodiversity research and conservation.  So we branched 
our codebase, recentered the map on Costa Rica, and imported
the species data INBio gave us.

INBio's dataset was quite small: the most observations for 
a single species was 700 for <i>Automeris zugana</i>, a moth 
with prominent wing eyespots that you can 
[see here getting eaten](http://caterpillar-eyespots.blogspot.com.au/2011/08/automeris-zugana-pwnd1.html)
by a
[tailless whip scorpion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblypygi),
which is not actually a scorpion.

This meant I had a perfect opportunity to look at displaying
observations on a map.  This is easy; just put a dot at
the x/y location of each observation.

For example, here's a map of Costa Rica with occurrences of 
<i>automeris zugana</i> drawn on as little circles:

<img src="{{ basepath }}/images/clustering-costarica-zugana-dots.png" />

You can see that this moth has been found across more-or-less the whole country,
with a more dense area in the north-western corner.  But with this view,
you're missing information &mdash; can you tell where the second most dense
area is?

Here's a different rendering of the same observations, 
but this time I'll cover the map with squares, and write the number of observations
in each square:

<img src="{{ basepath }}/images/clustering-costarica-zugana-grid.png" />

If you spend a few seconds looking at the numbers, you can see that 
north-western corner definitely has the lion's share of observations,
with a 210 square and a couple of 60-ish squares.  But the map is all
ugly now, with a big grid over it.  I could try making the grid lines
fainter, but what about just hiding the empty squares?
