Simply stated, the goal of the Australian Bird Species Distribution
Project (ABSDP) is to model the effect of climate change on Australian bird 
populations.

This modelling is important to both climatological and zoological 
researchers, and for policy making in government and elsewhere
with respect to land care, conservation planning, and similar areas.

Feeding accurate input data to the modelling process is essential
for good results, and to that end this project also includes mechanisms
to allow expert reviewers to vet species occurrence records, a process
that has previously been laborious and difficult to share.
